# node-sequelize-noupdate-attributes

A very simple [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) plugin which adds **no update** and **readonly** attributes support.

## Prerequisites

Have previously installed the `sequelize` package in the project.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save sequelize-noupdate-attributes
```

## Usage

Add the plugin to the sequelize instance and then set the noupdate
properties in your models, as shown in the basic example below:

```js
var sequelizeNoUpdateAttributes = require('sequelize-noupdate-attributes');

var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'user', 'password');
sequelizeNoUpdateAttributes(sequelize); // Note that is the `sequelize` instance the passed reference.

var Post = sequelize.define('Post', {
  content: {
    type    : Sequelize.STRING,
    noUpdate: true
  }
});
```

What this do is to mark the `content` attribute so if an update is done, then:

* if the field previous value is null, it will accept the change
* if the field previous value is not null, it will trigger a `SequelizeValidationErrorItem` error.

so, the `content` field becomes a **readonly** after its becomes not null.

Works too with foreign key fields in associations:

```js
models.Post.belongsTo(models.Person, {
  as        : 'Creator',
  foreignKey: {
    allowNull: false,
    noUpdate : true    // Will mark the `CreatorId` field to be `noUpdate`d.
  }
});
```

### Readonly attributes

If you do want truly **readonly** attributes with no modifications at all
being allowed, you can use the `readonly` option as shown below:

```js
var Post = sequelize.define('Post', {
  content: {
    type    : Sequelize.STRING,
    readOnly: true
  }
});

var Post = sequelize.define('Post', {
  content: {
    type    : Sequelize.STRING,
    noUpdate: {
      readOnly: true
    }
  }
});
```

which effectively disables any modification on the `content` attribute,
no matter if the previous value was null or not, though exception is
when the record is new.
